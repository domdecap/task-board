#  [Task Board](https://domdecap.github.io/task-board/)

A Kanban style task board

##  Description

This is a Kanban style task board, with the ability to create a task, drag to a new lane, and delete tasks. The task board will also stay current when the page is reloaded.

## Contributors

I was given starter code for this project from out Bootcamp Spot Module. I also leveraged ChatGPT for help with creating the task card and how to delete the task from the page.
